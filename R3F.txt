Core React Three Fiber Basics
<Canvas> setup – how to create the 3D scene in React.

Meshes & geometry – making shapes (boxGeometry, sphereGeometry, planeGeometry, circleGeometry, cylinderGeometry).

Materials – coloring objects and using textures (meshStandardMaterial, meshBasicMaterial, transparency).

Position, rotation, scale – moving and sizing objects in 3D space.

Interaction & Animation
Pointer events – onClick, onPointerOver, onPointerOut to detect hover/clicks on objects.

State-based movement – using React state (useState) to trigger changes.

useFrame animations – frame-by-frame movement for smooth transitions.

Curved paths – THREE.QuadraticBezierCurve3 or THREE.CatmullRomCurve3 for arcs and curves.

Tweening libraries – GSAP or React Spring for smooth easing animations.

Images & Models
Loading textures – useLoader(TextureLoader, "image.jpg") to put an image on an object.

Custom shapes for images – mapping textures to a plane, circle, or cylinder.

Loading 3D models – useGLTF for importing .glb / .gltf models (optional, for complex shapes like a realistic pan lid).

Scene Enhancements
Lighting – ambientLight, directionalLight, etc., so textures and shapes are visible.

OrbitControls – from @react-three/drei for rotating and zooming the camera.

If you learn 1–10, you can already make:

Multiple 3D objects close together

Clickable/hoverable objects

Smooth or curved movement

Custom images (like your pan lid) in 3D space
